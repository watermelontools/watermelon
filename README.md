**Watermelon is an Open Source Copilot For Code Review**. Our GitHub application allows developers to pre-review GitHub Pull Requests by tracing their code context and performing static code analysis. Using LLMs to detect errors, compare intent to implementation, and give the PR a first health check.

We've built a search algorithm that indexes the most relevant [code context](https://www.watermelontools.com/post/what-is-passive-code-documentation-why-is-it-hard-to-scale-what-to-do-about-it) for a given pull request.

## Integrations

We currently support the following integrations

| Git                                     | Project Management | Messaging | Documentation      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :-------- | :----------------- |
| GitHub                                  | Jira, Linear, Asana      | Slack     | Notion, Confluence |

## Features

Watermelon's GitHub application allows teams to contextualize pull requests with code context from different sources.

Our GitHub application also identifies errors in your codebase. Beginning with the detection of console logs (and their equivalents across various major programming languages), Watermelon comments PR line diffs whenever an error is detected. Expanded capabilities in identifying a broader range of errors soon.

Finally, our GitHub app uses "LLMs as Reviewer Zero". Watermelon evaluates the traced code context against the intent of the Pull Request. Based on these insights, it labels them as "üçâ Safe To Merge", "üëÄ Take a Deeper Dive", or "üö® Don't Merge".
